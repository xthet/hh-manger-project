You’ll be fighting, trading, negotiating. And then fighting some more. Navigate through treacherous, monster-infested waters, take on the dreaded Navy, trade, explore dungeons and make friends and foes alike as you explore a new world!</p> <p><br/> <br/> </p> <p>With over 200,000 downloads on Steam, you won’t be sailing alone. Come on board and feel the breeze in your beards* as we sail into a new chapter for Piratopia together!</p> <p><br/> <br/> </p> <p>*for the unbearded, hook-ons are available for a modest fee.</p> <p><br/> <br/> </p> <p>Piratopia's Creator</p> <p>The brainchild of Adi Zhavo, Game Director at Popcore and creator of cult PvP arena brawler Gladio &amp; Glory, Piratopia began its life as a one-man project developed during off-work hours while Adi juggled full-time work as a Game Producer.</p> <p><br/> <br/> </p> <p>Now, in collaboration with Project 99, Piratopia is getting a major upgrade from an addictive IO-style sea brawler to a brand new multiplayer game with a graphic overhaul, a bigger world, and tons of new features!</p> <p><br/> <br/> </p> <p>Map of Astillia</p> <p>Before his death, &quot;Bloodhound&quot; Addicus left pages of his journal scattered across the Seven Seas of Astillia, detailing several ancient monuments lost beneath the waves. Legend has it that anyone who manages to retrieve these monuments will be granted untold riches and ultimate mastery of the oceans.</p> <p><br/> <br/> </p> <p>Factions</p> <p>Choose whether to ally or war with the many world factions in Piratopia, and reap the rewards as you unlock unique quests while building your reputation with them.</p> <p>Factions in Piratopia may offer you different trade options and access to different materials and crew. It's up to you to discover them all!</p> <p>Featuring three unique classes (and three more on the way), sail the Seven Seas and lay waste to your enemies as the high-speed Cruiser, the hard-wearing Dreadnought, or the devastating Destroyer. Master their unique playstyles and skills, and make the seas your…old salty dog.</p> <p><br/> <br/> </p> <p>Gear</p> <p>How well your ship runs isn’t arbitrary. From extra armor plating to hyper propellers, no pirate worth their salt would ever leave their ship's gear unattended and un-upgraded!</p> <p>Each ship gets up to five Gear slots. Gear is important – what you choose can make the difference between moving faster, being more durable, or having more firepower. Choose the right build for an edge in different encounters.</p> <p>You also get up to three weapon slots. This is how you’ll lay waste to enemies. As you get stronger, you’ll have to choose between your elements of destruction. Will you be a massive tank, mowing down all before you? Or a speedy cruiser, pewpew-ing with lasers?</p> <p>And the pretty pretty sparklies…the gems. Who knows what they might do to your gear, eh?</p> <p><br/> <br/> </p> <p>Weaponry</p> <p>What CAN’T you attack people with?

I did say it was all about the gear. Through gear crafting, you can tweak and balance your stats all you want as you pirate your way through the world.
